Repository for assignment 2 in _Principles of Object Oriented Programming_. Design and implementation of a basic polynomial calculator.
The crux of this assignment was supporting multiple kinds of number fields (e.g. Real, rational, etc.)
and their different operation (e.g. addition, multiplication, etc.)
while keeping the software modular using object oriented tools such as interfaces.
